\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
for std\+::vector 

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm}{\texttt{ Strassen\textquotesingle{}s algorithm}} is one of the methods for multiplying two matrices. It is one of the faster algorithms for larger matrices than naive multiplication method.

for assert for string for IO operations

It involves dividing each matrices into 4 blocks, given they are evenly divisible, and are combined with new defined matrices involving 7 matrix multiplications instead of eight, yielding O(n\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}2.8073) complexity.
